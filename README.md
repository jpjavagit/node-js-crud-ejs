# Ejs Template Engine

This node.js application I created to show how EJS works, works fine I think, but I believe that we can use others templates engine like Jade, Handlebars or even Angular.

This example was generated by Express with NoSQL database MongoDB that is an excellent document database that working with Mongoose works very well.

*You make sure that you have Node and MongoDB installed in your system 

### Steps

Open the terminal to execute this steps

Nº 1:
```sh
$ npm install
```
The command above will download all necessary libraries.

Nº 2:
```sh
$ npm start
```
The command above will start the application in the port 3000

### MongoDB

Nº 1:
```sh
$ mongo
```
Nº 2:
```sh
$ use users
```
Nº 3:
```sh
$ show collections;
```
MongoDB is a database based in documents and there is no tables like a relational databases instead tables we use collections.

With this command you'll see the collection called "users"

### Ejs

Note that I don't used pages wit HTML extension but .ejs. Ejs is template engine to control and passsing parameters to the page becoming a dynamic page.

The snippet bellow is example of Ejs, it's like a Scriptlet usually found in JSP pages:

```sh
$ <%= item.firstname %>
```
